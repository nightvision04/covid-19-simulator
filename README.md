## Overview
The follow script simulates the effect of population density (in Edmonton, Alberta) on infection rate of the Covid-19 virus. It follows a simple set of rules:

- The probability of passing infection is normally distributed over the contagious period.

- Some people are properly following quarantine, others are not.

- The first cases (5) start in dense zones.

- People tend to stay local during an outbreak.

I do not claim to be an epidemiologist. This simulation is simply to satisfy my own curiosity about the delayed effects of population density on various behaviors and infection levels.

## Interpretation
Medium gray dots represent people who have not yet been infected, black dots represent the infected, and the lightest dots represent the recovered.

A csv file is also generated so you can produced your own charts in Excel from the raw simulation output.

## Simulation
The simulation can be ran over and over, each time producing a reliable outcome despite being produced from a different seed.

## Final Thoughts
Your participation is critical to limiting peak pressure on the medical system. Please share if you are looking for resources to convince other Edmontonians of the critical nature of this epidemic.
